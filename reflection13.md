The findings indicate that the system has the potential to speed the transformation and upgrading of conventional museums, as well as increase the economic and social advantages of museums.

Visual digital systems will become the core portion and crucial cornerstone of the digital museum's main business in the future. It can realize multi-screen interaction, data communication, data cooperation, data sharing, data storage, and other functions through the display device in the visual digital system, thus breaking through the traditional operation mode of the museum and eliminating the information island between people, people and things, and things and things, which not only makes the digital museum meet the personalized needs of tourists in the era of big data, but also improves the d
