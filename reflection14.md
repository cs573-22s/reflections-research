This week I found a very interesting research paper, a research team from Charlottesville identified gaps in information and useful features to build a guide for policing data collection and analysis for public accountability, based on the practices of other cities around the US.

The research team found that recent waves of policing reform movement have prompted policing jurisdictions to make their policing data more publicly available, open, and actionable. The goal of this project was to examine the condition of policing data in the United States, collect a trustworthy body of policing data, and see if policing data might be utilized to provide meaningful descriptive insights. Based on our findings, we also highlight certain ethical implications for academics who use police data to conduct meaningful research.

They urge that Charlottesville gather and disclose more information on the police, including color, gender, and age. Furthermore, we urge that the datasets provided be expanded to include at least current stop data. The review board might then use that data in a manner similar to how the dashboard given in this study is put out. The board would get insight into an officer's background or evaluate how the force as a whole is functioning well, and then translate that data into more questions to slve it out.
