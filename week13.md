["Exploring Uncertainty in Geodemographics with Interactive Graphics"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6065022)

This is another research paper by Jason Dykes and Jo Wood. This time, however, it's an older one that takes a look at
how interactive visualizations changed what was thought to be possible. This paper, similarly to last week's, also looked
at census data in the UK, but this was more of new development as they remarked that this was only possible because
of desktop computers growing capacity to handle large amounts of data and so visualizations that can compress data will
only become more necessary. Again, dealing with graphically-related data, the researchers took mostly data related to 
living conditions like the countryside, city living, suburbs, and more and displayed them based on population density on a 
color-coded map of the UK. This general view helped the readers understand how each section was broken down, but the actual
view for this visualization was more of a matrix that could be manipulated and expanded. [This video](https://vimeo.com/25460216) does a 
good job showing off how not only is the all-encompassing graphical view able to take population density and compress the 
different living conditions into lossless color representations, but in the matrix view, which is still sorted by location,
you can also see more in-depth breakdowns. Each area of the country is divided and then subdivided a the viewers' request and 
upon selection, you can see a larger breakdown of different variables assigned to each location. While normally matrixes are
hard to read this is more of an area chart and is relativity intuitive and a good representation of the actual population
breakup concerning living conditions rather than the geolocation representation which, seems to skew the countryside representation
only because there's so much land. The only real problem with this visualization that I can see is the fact that they decided to
use a line graph to represent the values saved in each section of the chart. The problem is that these values don't relate
to each other, so a bar graph or something that displayed values independently would have been more fitting in this example. Overall,
this visualization was rather interesting, and with the comparative opportunities it offered, I could see its use or 
future improvement.
