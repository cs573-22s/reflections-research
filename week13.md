# Judging Correlation from Scatterplots and Parallet Coordinate Plots

[This](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220586700_Judging_Correlation_from_Scatterplots_and_Parallel_Coordinate_Plots) paper covers the key differences in perception performance that scatterplots give over parallel coordinates. I have considered a parallel coordinate like plot as a potential visual feature to include in my final project, so seeing a direct comparison between the two types of correlation visualization is very valuable. They found that the parallel coordinate plots preform worse than scatterplot for participants judging direction and intensity of correlation. Whats interesting here to me is their methods for evaluating this performance. They generated multiple types of coorelations, strong negative, negative, neutral, positive, strong positive, and had participants judge which category each plot fell into. Additionally, they also tested for limited and unlimited times, allowing for a comparison between more instinctual reactions and what can be thought of as careful thought. In both catagories, scatterplots were more effective at conveying information, which due to these methods, shows good proof that they are better for conveying correlation in more conditions than parallel plots. Specifically, they found that in p-plots, users intepret weak positive as no correlation and no correlation as negative. Overall, this study helps to further narrow down how people percieve correlation and what some weaknesses with current correlation visualization techniques are. I will most likely use this paper to help justify using scatter plots since they are more consistent. I will also use this to inform descision about what visual features to emphasize in animations and feedback.
