The author shows the immigration data of the United States based on census data. The analysis is limited to the 29 countries that actually qualified for the World Cup and that have country-of-origin data available in the census (Tunisia, Senegal and Iceland are omitted). The data is used to generate a map, with bubbles showing the largest foreign-born population in each county.

The large number of Mexican immigrants throughout the United States obscures other interesting patterns. So another map shows the same data, except it excludes Mexican immigrants. Here it shows large swaths of German and Korean immigrants.

The map also shows that every country’s population is distributed in different ways. Polish immigrants are clustered near Chicago, Koreans in Los Angeles, and there are small pockets of Basque Spaniards in eastern Oregon and Idaho. These maps show where people born in each World Cup country make up the largest share of the total county population.
