This paper discusses the graph based methods of data exploration. The researchers of this paper focused on the visualizing medical data of patients. They were using raw data and creating mutliple types of figures to show the underlying connections within the data. Throughout the paper, they show various networkings to graph all of the connections of the patients. They have complicated depictions for showing the network of nodes and adding layered visuilizations as glyphs for each node. From this kind of visualization, tey were able to more easily classify and identify patients that were similar to each other in different aspects. This could also be used in the medical felid to help understand why some patients may or may not be classified in a certain way. For the visulaizations in the nodes, the researchers used radar plots and bar charts mainly. This is because of the simplicity in understanding the information that they display. They use these visualizations and the data to then reduce the visualized network using incremental graphs to create more simplified versions for displaying the data while still considering the classifications and partitions that were identified. The researchers created this as a method that medical personel and other researchers could use an overview of areas of interest within the patient set. This has the potential to be applied to other formas of data orothr patient sets in order to show different entity types within the given datasets.
