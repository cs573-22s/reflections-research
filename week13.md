## Summary
In this study, the researchers performed a classic visualization experiment by having participants interpret bar charts and pie graphs. The novelty of the research is that the participants also wore an fNIRS cap to record their brain data with the interest in defining cognitive states while they interpreted data visualizations. Through their study, they were able to measure the impact of visual design on the brain while also showing there are not universal differences in bar graphs and pie charts. 

## Takeaways
While there are not inherent differences between bar graphs and pie charts in the brain, different visualizations can evoke a greater amount of cognitive workload. This is measureable with fNIRS and could be used in future visualization research to determine which visualizations are less complicated for a user to understand. It was noted that the cognitive workload is not easily measured with simple visualizations and should only be used to evaluate more complex designs.
