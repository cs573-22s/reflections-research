Introduction

This is a quite long paper which talks about evaluation of data visualization methods. 
Due to the complex data and requirements, organizations often require effective visualization methods which impact business decisions and convince stakeholders. 
This is a similar challenge in the development of a software
demonstrator for the innovative safety radar system at ABB Jokab Safety whose aim
is to improve the detection reliability using multiple radar sensors and requires an
effective visualization method which will satisfy all the requirements.

The main objective of this study is to explore different data visualization methods involved in illustrating the raw data and with the help of developers,
and other team members feedback with reference to existing literature and filter them with respect to the system functionalities. 
Establish evaluation criteria with relevant metrics to perform analytic evaluations on the visualization methods to determine an effective method.

The results from this research provide insight into how data visualization evaluations can be implemented for real-time industrial problems 
and furnish validation process to determine an effective data visualization method. 
This study helps object detection using similar radar technologies visualize their data in an effective way 
and provides a scientific approach for evaluating similar data visualization
problems.
