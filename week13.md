Week 13 Reflection - What Happened in my Home?: An End-User Development Approach for Smart Home Data Visualization
--
It is always interesting to see data visualization in action. Applications of data visualization in Smart Home provides a new perspectives on how visualizations and data can improve our life quality. A team from Germany developed a data visualzation system for Smart Home with integrated basic graphs as well as a visualization creataion tool.

In their research, they look into providing data-related use cases and related information necessary for a user to satisfy a specific need, demonstrating the concept and development of a hybrid interface that includes pre-defined visualizations and a visualization creation tool that lets users without programming skills extend the system (end-user development) and providing information on using as well as integrating the open .DASH prototype and on the appropriation of our approach for visualizing smart home data. This is a demonstration of their application.
