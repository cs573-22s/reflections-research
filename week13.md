# Week 13:

My reflection for this week is [this paper](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Harri-Siirtola/publication/221360091_Visual_Perception_of_Parallel_Coordinate_Visualizations/links/5da5a65945851553ff930b4b/Visual-Perception-of-Parallel-Coordinate-Visualizations.pdf).

This paper is about visual perception of parallel coordinate visualizations. Parallel coordinates is a visualization technique that provides an unbiased representation of high-dimensional data.

## Introduction

The paper starts of with explaining the advantages of using parallel plot visualizations which include:
1. Treating all data dimensions equally.
2. Display all dimesnsions simultaneously
3. Can be clubbed with logical connectives like AND, OR, XOR

The authors then go on to show what a parallel coordinate visualization looks like. 

## Literature review and previous studies: 

A previous study as shown that although first-time users struggle with using parallel coordinate plots, participants learn to use them rapidly. This study is different because it focuses on the visual perception of parallel coordinate visualizations by using eye tracking equipment to capture the gaze behavior of participants. The idea is to study if people are focussing attention on the right areas or not. 

## The study

1. 9 participants were randomly chosen and were screened to have some experience in data viz.
2. The eye data was captured for 7 people.
3. Fixations before, fixation duration mean, fixation count were then noted for the area of interest. 
4. The dataset was the cars dataset and there were 9 questions which were asked including a practice question 1 which was not disclosed to the participants.

## Results

People described the visualization and while 2 of them had seen them before others described it as a hassle and hard to understand. Balloon plots were created for all tasks marking the AOIs for each and measuring the time spent by users on them. 

## Conclusion

Usually, visualizations on parallel coordinates are regarded as an expert only technique, this experiment contradicts that assumption and show that usability is high. These visualizations should be used in mainstream softwares.
