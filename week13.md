Interaction is fundamental to data visualization, but what “interaction” means in the context of visualization is ambiguous
and confusing. We argue that this confusion is due to a lack of consensual definition. To tackle this problem, we start by synthesizing
an inclusive view of interaction in the visualization community – including insights from information visualization, visual analytics and
scientific visualization, as well as the input of both senior and junior visualization researchers. Once this view takes shape, we look at
how interaction is defined in the field of human-computer interaction (HCI). By extracting commonalities and differences between the
views of interaction in visualization and in HCI, we synthesize a definition of interaction for visualization. Our definition is meant to be
a thinking tool and inspire novel and bolder interaction design practices. We hope that by better understanding what interaction in
visualization is and what it can be, we will enrich the quality of interaction in visualization systems and empower those who use them.

Our methodology for critical reviews that incorporates human expertise and quantitative metrics allowed us to analyze (i) mandatory and
optional components of interaction as well as its properties, (ii) the
benefits and critiques on the interaction topic, and (iii) the current
conceptualization of interaction in visualization. By comparing our
findings from the visualization literature with the view of interaction
from the HCI literature, we identified opportunities for broadening the
view of interaction in visualization on (i) user intentionality, (ii) user
profiling, and (iii) what good interaction is. That comparison led us to
distill the fundamental differences between visualization and HCI that
are related to entities, focus, intent and flexibility of interaction.
Building on these findings, we gave one answer to the question “what
is interaction for data visualization?” through a compact definition that
captures human intent and interaction causality, is technology agnostic,
and includes the full spectrum of human senses.
Finally, our operationalization of the notion of within-the-tool flexibility is an example of making this definition actionable. By categorizing interactions based on data-level actions and intents in relation to the
visualization pipeline, we provide a systematic approach for describing
and comparing visualization systems. This operationalization can aid
visualization designers estimate how modifiable a visualization system
is, and how diverse the palette of available interactions is.
We hope that our inclusive view of interaction will unify the visualization community under a common goal: the creation of visualization
systems that empower those who use them.
