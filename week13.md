Paper Title: Observations and Reflections on Visualization Literacy in Elementary School

This paper looks into how visualization literacy could be better taught in elementary schools. The paper observes how teachers instruct and how their students acquire basic visualization principles and skills in elementary schools. This study looks into how young children are able to properly understand and depict various visualizations. In the past, it was believed that understanding visualizations were relatively inherent and trivial, which has been proven to not be the case for all parties. While there is a saying that "A picture says a thousand words," this phrase fails to understand that sometimes these photos may be more difficult to understand than words are. This misconception has lead to a rise in visualization illiteracy, which could eventually result in misinformation. The study focuses on what happens during the early stages of education, like what is learned by children of visual representations, how they are taught the principles, and the skills necessary to interact and create visualizations. They were able to collect empirical data from diverse sources from a visualization literacy article about an elementary school in 2017. They came to the conclusion that visualizations are very present in grades K-4, but that the time taken to learn how to interpret these visualization is only a small fraction of the curriculum. They also found that teachers believe visualizations are intuitive, which is not true as many believe children are not prepared enough to properly read the visualizations that populate their textbooks. They also found that elementary students learn how to read and create visualizations very early in their career, but they are not taught how to approach them in a critical manner. To conclude, the researchers believe that to approach expanding visualization literacy in elementary school, students would be to read beyond the graphics, do more critical thinking, and connect other literacies with abilities. To read beyond the graphics, children should know when and how to create a visual representation of data to facilitate the extraction of information, and how to also interpret visual representation in order to read directly from the data. To improve critical thinking, children should be able to interpret and critique the data representation to ensure it is not misleading, implying that they know the perceptial and cognitive biases that may occur during the decoding of the dataset. To connect with other literacies and abilities, children should learn how to cross check conclusions drawn from visual data analysis, by consulting other information sources, and to improve other abilities like sensemaking and visual thinking which enables connecting multiple pieces of information together and challenges established visual conventions to best fit analytic and communication needs. This study is able to utilize past and current datasets to draw conclusions about areas where children are lacking in their visualization literacies, and have found areas to improve upon.
