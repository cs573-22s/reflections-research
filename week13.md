Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis is a way to cluster RNA-seq analysis data by trends across conditions providing novel insights into metabolic pathways. This is the dataset we will be using to perform our visualization and I wanted to use their visualizations as comparisons and figure out ways to improve upon them.

Most of their figures are difficult to gain any biological insight due to the static and dense nature of them. By adding interactivity to our charts, these large figures can be parsed and searched to gain understanding.
