This week I found a very interesting research paper, a research team from Santa Clara proposed a timeline visualization tool that enables us to better understand traffic behaviors from road traffic big data. A timeline visualization for traffic big data. The timeline visualization system provides several events such as traffic congestion and traffic accidents in chronological order. 

Proper visualization of traffic big data can help users to easily understand and find traffic information such as data comparisons, data patterns, or data relationships.
