The title of this week's paper is The Value of Visualization: https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.75.6547&rep=rep1&type=pdf

This course has almost come to an end, and we have learned the basics of data visualization, including the various types of charts, applications, etc. And at the end of this semester, I'd like to come back to the most basic and essential part, the value of visualization.

As the authors said, the field of visualization is getting mature. Many problems have been solved, and new directions are sought for. In order to make
good choices, an understanding of the purpose and meaning of visualization is needed. And it's very important to to assess what a good visualization is.

In this paper, an economic model of visualization is presented where the adopted viewpoint is that the value of visualization is measured based on effectiveness and efficiency. The authors use the model to judge the methods that visualization use and to determine the reason why these methods are used. And they also evaluate the visualization on both art and scientic points of view.

Here is the basic model of visualization. The authors use a visualization way to describe the systematical process of visualization:

And with this model and its abstract parameters, by assessing values to it, there is a way to numerically determine whether a visualization method is worthwhile.

But there are many things are affecting the value of a visualization, there is not a single answer to tell the value of a visualization, it depends on the point of view one adopts. However, there are still some wonderful points that can determine whether a visualization is of value, including the provable effectiveness and efficiency, elegance and beauty,
and generic laws with predictive power.
