This week I found a very interesting research paper, it's about researcher tried to visualize the movement of animal. Rather than traditional method of observing movement and behavior in small numbers of animals over short time spans and in small regions, researchers may use GPS collars to follow numerous animals across big areas and long time spans. These massive databases have the potential to yield a wealth of knowledge on animal behavior. However, in order to contextualize the movements and projected behaviors, this tracking data must be combined with geographical data about the surroundings.

Researchers can use tracking data to capture movement across huge areas and locations that are difficult for people to reach. Researchers may also use tracking data to monitor movements over lengthy periods of time and continuous stretches of time, offering significant insight into behavior across time.
