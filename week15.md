This is a visualization of how inclusive the beauty brands are around the world. It combined a handful of bestseller lists to come up with a list of six products that appeared at least twice. Despite the fact that Fenty’s darkest foundations flew off the shelves, many of the mainstream brands are still missing the mark for so many people across the country. So the author decided to take a look at brands that are marketed to and recommended for BIPOC. They surveyed twelve articles for brands (with foundation products) that were mentioned four or more times and came up with two lists.

They then sampled their liquid foundation product line with the widest range of shades and used Fenty as a point of comparison. Fenty foundations have a wider range of shades than Make Up Forever. Many of the mainstream brands and Fenty have a wide assortment of shades for BIPOC. Very few brands support the darkest skin tone range (10 - 20 lightness). Fenty isn't one of them. If you have really light skin, Fenty or BIPOC-founded Beauty Bakeriehave got you covered. Having 40 shades as a BIPOC-created brand really makes Fenty unique.
