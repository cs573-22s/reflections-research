# Week 15

## My reflection for this week: 
**ConVIScope: Visual Analytics for Exploring Patient Conversations**

https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.13514.pdf

This paper is about a system called ConVIScope. There can be a large number of patient and doctor conversation which has lots of important information. These information could be used to better understand the problem across demographics, about the patients themselves and the healthcare services. So, in the paper, they present the visualization system to analyze such data and gain insights from it.

They perform natural language processing to extract data from the conversations between patients and healthcare services. Then, the information is visualized to extract information and trends. The system integrates two interesting views called Trend view and Conversation Analysis View. The Conversation View visualizes summary of the entire conversations, with topics and the sentiment. And, the trend view Trend View allows the user to explore how how the topics evolve over time. These views allows the user to see which topic is being discussed and when. User can quickly navigate around the large number of data with focus+context technique by having a single continuous display and shrinking the size of content outsize a fixed display window. They also integrate a view with stacked bar chart to display the sentiment of the patient. This can be used to know if the patent is satisfied with the service or not and how this relates to different groups of people.
