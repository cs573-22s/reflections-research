# Correlation Estimates as Perceptual Judgments

[This](https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/1997-03016-001.pdf) paper talks about predicting how people would respond to changes in certain acpects of scatterplots with regards to correlation judgements. They found that perception of the geometric features was what people used to judge the correclation, mostly based on intuition. They found that its best to think of correlation judgemnts as estimates of the deviation from perfect correlation. This is a very useful percpective they have because framing the problem in this way generates many more ideas for how one would create a visual element to judge the correlation. For the distance visual element referenced in one of the earlier papers I covered, this one proves to be a promising subject for improvement, with potentially some sort of animation. They also found the changes in slope can effect how people estimate. Higher slopes can lead to lower estimates because the overall dispercion of the points increases. Thus, for my experiment, it might be vital to add the option to change the slope to see how different methods perform in different slope conditions. Overall, this paper is quite helpful for understanding the base research behind correlation judgement. Many of the ideas in this paper grew to be the other papers that I am basing my work off, so getting this deep understanding is valuable.
