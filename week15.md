## Summary
Historical linguistic data is often sparse and multidimensional, causing great problems when trying to visualize it. ParHisVis is a tool made to visualize this data by inserting it into a tabular form where each piece of text is associated with a number of dimensions and features that pertain to it. As long as each piece of text and its associated dimensions/features are in the same row, ParHistVis can use the data file. They employeed aggregated views of the data to help with the multidimensionality problem, along with incorporating color coding. Finally, they demonstrated a use case where the tool was used with real-world data collected in 2018. In the use case, they showed how ParHistVis can expose relationships between different pieces of text. 

## Takeaways
This paper is a different approach to the multidimensional problem that seems to be effective. They by pass most of the guidelines suggested in previous papers by still using bar charts, but aggregating different views together to increase the amount of data visualized at a time. In addition, the visualizations they use are somewhat more complex than standard bar charts, but supposedly are not highly taxing on the brain. Future work could investigate the cognitive workload their tool evokes through use of fNIRS.
