This paper is another discussion of the multimodal visualization. However, this one is more about the applications of it in the medical feild. Having multimodal visualization techniques is an asset in the medica feild as it allows for a stronger more accurate analysis of a specific concern or focus area. The multiple different analysis and visualization types can help to confirm or disprove findings of a patients condition. This increases the accuracy and quality of given diagnoses, treatments, and interdisiplinary communication between patient and doctor or doctor and doctor. Being able to look at data from different aspects also increase the chances of finding abmormalities that might have been missed using only one technique or method. Methods such as computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound, and hybrid scanners were mentioned by these researchers. Such methods are used in collaboration with one another to analyse lare amounts of data from a single person. Also, many methods can be considered multimodal on their own because of the way they acquire data. Computed tomography for example uses stacks of 2D images and information form high and low voltage images to create differentiation between structures and fluids within the patient that is eing analyzed. High levels of segmentation and data collection are expected from the medical feild in terms of data types or structures, so it is important to be able to make such vast amounts of data intosomething that is more easily understood, interpreted, and communicated by both the patient and the doctor.
