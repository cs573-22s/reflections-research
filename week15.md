Drug discovery projects in the pharmaceutical industry accumulate thousands of chemical structures and tenthousands of data points from a dozen or more biological and pharmacological assays. A sufficient interpretation of the data requires understanding, which molecular families are present, which structural motifs correlate with measured properties, and which tiny structural changes cause large property changes. Data visualization and analysis software with sufficient chemical intelligence to support chemists in this task is rare. In an attempt to contribute to filling the gap, we released our in-house developed chemistry aware data analysis program DataWarrior for free public use. This paper gives an overview of DataWarrior’s functionality and architecture. Exemplarily, a new unsupervised, 2-dimensional scaling algorithm is presented, which employs vector-based or nonvector-based descriptors to visualize the chemical or pharmacophore space of even large data sets. DataWarrior uses this method to interactively explore chemical space, activity landscapes, and activity cliffs.

We have shown that DataWarrior is a universal data analysis and visualization program, whose embedded cheminformatics algorithms make it a versatile tool to explore large data sets of chemical structures with alphanumerical properties. DataWarrior uses both published and new cheminformatics algorithms to support synthetic and medicinal chemists in their daily work. These include combinatorial library enumeration, the prediction of molecular properties, and various methods to visualize chemical space and activity cliffs with the intent to support chemists taking smarter decisions about structural changes toward better property profiles. A new 2-dimensional scaling method “Rubber Band Scaling” was introduced and compared to the principal component analysis and the self-organizing map for the purpose ofvisualizing the chemical space of medium sized compound collections. One advantage of the method is that all molecule markers are evenly distributed, and none of the molecules are hidden behind others. Hence, this method is well suited when all molecules need to be shown, e.g. for visualizing activity space or activity cliffs. Differen to PCAs and SOMs, this method can be used with complex, nonvector descriptors like the Flexophore, which allows to visualize potential binding behavior space of chemical libraries. The Rubber Band Scaling algorithm is part of the DataWarrior application. DataWarrior was released in 2014 as a free tool that can be downloaded for Linux, Macintosh or Windows from http:// www.openmolecules.org/datawarrior.html. Associated Content.
