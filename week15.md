This paper discusses the problem of visualizing large webpages. They can be difficult to navigate and there is no way to track what movements have already been done. They introduce a tool that helps with these problems. 

They basically created an index and sidebar that tracks time spent at each section of the webpage and visualizes that with a heatmap. 

I am interested in using this tool to help navigate our heatmaps as it is multiple "pages" long and cannot be viewed all in one screen. While I do not think this is exactly what I wanted, it is helpful to read through their considerations and concerns when building this tool.
