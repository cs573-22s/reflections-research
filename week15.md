In their paper "Affective Colour Palettes in Visualization", Patra et al. (2016) examine how different properties of color communicate affect in information visualizations and show how different color properties can be used to change the desired affect in a visualization. They observe that affect is especially important in applications of visualization in fields such as marketing or journalism. Red is considered to be hot and intense across cultures while yellow is unprofessional and blue is serious. To explore color association, Patra et al. selected eight different affects: Positive, Negative, Calm, Exciting, Serious, Playful, Trustworthy
and Disturbing. They first analyzed 12000 images, finding that Calm, Playful, and Exciting images were lighter than Disturbing and Negative, while Calm and Trustworthy images were more blue and green, amongst other observations. 

Patra et al. used k-means clustering to generate 8 sets of 40 distinct hues. For each set, they calculated the conditional probability of a candidate color from a given set given an affect value and corresponding image histogram by applying kernel density estimation to the histogram to find the probability of a given color for affect across images. The most distinctive hues were selected to fit across affects. Patra et al. then ran experiments in which participants created affective palettes using the set of selected colors, allowing them to determine that participants would consistently certain colors to each affective category.

While their results weren't particularly surprising, I thought the methods used by Patra et al. to be quite interesting, as I am interested in how subjective topics such as mood and color association can be empirically measured. I though their use of k-means clustering to generate sets of hues was especially clever, as I hadn't seen the algorithm applied that way. This paper also might be useful in determining which color palette to use to communicate a specific affect if I find myself unsure.
