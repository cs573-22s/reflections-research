["Small Multiples with Gaps"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7536128)

The first paper I came across by Jason Dykes and Jo Wood involved a very clever use of small multiples to handle many different
types of data to be displayed on one map. This paper also focuses on small multiples however not as a way to display many different
types of data but rather on how to display all the data from a graphical source as solely small multiples. Organizing the small 
multiple graphs in such a way that resembles their geographical position (spacing data from different cities with regard to where
the actual city is placed geographically) can improve reading comprehension and allow for more complex conclusions to be drawn. 
I've run into this idea once before in a previous reflection where I found a map of US state migration which arranged each graph
roughly corresponding to where each state was. This paper specifically focused on the process of determining what the best
attribute of separating these graphs would produce the best results for every other attribute. The researchers were able to deduce
many reasonable and unreasonable categories to base differences on, mainly determining that Split Neighbors is a horrible determiner 
as it often doesn't increase readability or offer different observations any more than no white space at all. Overall, however, the
researchers found that in general including white space or gaps between charts to better display geographical distance allowed
for a much richer visualization overall. This paper seemed like the starting point for much of this specific work and 
this idea of spacially significant small multiples, the researchers called for many more research projects and papers to be 
done in the name of better quantifying possible aspects and even to possibly allow for different spacial options to be selected 
dynamically.
