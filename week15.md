Paper Title: Exploring Effective Data Visualization Strategies in Higher Education

This paper looks into how data visualization strategies are being utilized in higher education and where data is used and gathered from. They looked into studies in how those in higher education create visualizations across a two month period. Based off of their literature review and recorded factors, they created a set of trainings that covered topics relating to data report repositories, ad-hoc data manipulation tools, and data dashboard utilization. The training prioritized building institutional awareness and increased the utilization of data tools and resources. Responses were recorded using a questionaire based on principles of data visualization and graph literacy. They found that participants indicated brighter colors utilized in visual graphs draw more attention and that dashboard filter functions, category labels, and data tables were noted as stand out features that 82.8% of the participants suggested that the data was easy to read and comprehend. This research helped identify the factors within the data visualization and related the ease of readability and comprehension. However, the study also states that further research should be done in a broader scale to validate these findings, considering this was a small research group. This paper concludes that ease of readability and interpretation of data visualization is associated with functionality, titles, color, and layout.
