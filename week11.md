Human mind is very visual; data visualization is an ancient need. Since humans strived for survival they depicted hunting strategies on caves walls, they also kept statistics of how many animals and of what kind they caught on dwellings. In the history there are of visuals alphabets, like Phaistos, Sumerian, Assyrian cuneiform, were based on visuals rather than on sounds. Then, Egyptians and Maya civilizations, created pictographic images to communicate within social classes and across generations. For strategically purposes, maps were used to depict a kingdoms´ richness. The most antique map dates from 2500 B.C. from the city of Ga Sur at Nuzi (Mesopotamian) which describes the Euphrates river sided by two mountains. Homero map (Homero, 900BC) or Ptolemy map (Ptolemy, 200AD) are also very well known as the most important maps of the ancient world. In the sixteen century (1502) in the Portuguese discoveries the kingdoms richness and territories were depicted as shown in the Cantino map. Later, in the eighteen century, William Playfair, created various types of diagrams to depict statistical information, he wrote a book applying those representations techniques (Playfair, 1805). In our era in the 70´s the first infographics appeared in journals and magazines in order to summarize information and create a great impact in a massive way. Several practitioners and academicians in diverse areas need to present data graphically. From geographers, to economists, military, statisticians, engineers, biologists, to many others fields, many professionals need to see and understand data graphically. In this context, it is virtually impossible to relate to a particular field. On the other hand, the use of several disciplines in the design of data visualization artifacts is a reality. In fact, the use of principles, concepts, techniques and theories come from multiple backgrounds: programming, web design, semiotic or psychology.   These areas give an important contribute to the process of transforming data into understandable information; these areas complement each other.
