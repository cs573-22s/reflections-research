This week’s article can be found at https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0038038516674675?casa_token=abfdrSQFy1gAAAAA%3ApEeSKp8M3J6q4xioaXODWtaqIxTBwFlC4Kp2lLB2NMm-PAetERMykDrlJgLjdL7KYpyHX22n0dqLwA. It discusses the effects that emotions may have while people are interacting with data visualizations. It dives into how many studies have been done looking at how emotions interact with data visualizations, which turned out to not be that much in 2017. The researcher wanted to build off of sociology of emotions and the everyday to test this out. They also referenced the idea of ‘datafication’ which describes “quantifying aspects of life that previously did not exist numerically.” This is used often in terms of social media and displaying the number of likes, comments, followers, etc which encourages users to want to gain more.

For the actual experiment, the researchers found groups of people that were not at all experts in the field of data visualization. In terms of methods, they focused on focus groups, interviews, and diaries. They would group focus groups by people who were from pre-existing groups or communities. They had them look at different visualizations and record how they felt about each one, in order to understand what emotions they were feeling. In the end they determined that emotions do play a role in how people are able to interpret visualizations. They also learned that those with a formal math education were more likely to try to understand a visualization and “feeling numbers.” Those who had more exposure to STEM related subjects were more confident in their skills to understand the visualizations. This article was very interesting in seeing which groups had a better understanding of visualizations and how people reacted to them.
