This visualization researched over 100,000 happiness moments, and examined what vocabularies that people use when they are happy. Here the author used natural language processing to parse out the main subject, verb, and object of each happy moment. 
It first showed the ranking of the most used subjects, verbs, and objects in a bar graph. In addition to the happy moments, there is a pie chart showing predicted category for each. Although the estimates are rough, they appear to be a decent baseline and are interesting enough to look at more closely.

With sentences parsed into subject, verb, and object, along with predicted categories as a supplement, the author explored the most common types of happy moments for different subjects since moments with the self will be different from moments with a significant other or a stranger.
In the more complicated and detailed tree charts, the author breaks things down for the most common subjects, such as I, we, and friend. Follow the path for the most common verbs for a subject. Then take another step for the most common objects.
