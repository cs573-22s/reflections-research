Introduction
---
This paper enlightens us about the overview of Big Data, introduces the use of Augmented Reality and its concepts when it meets Big Data and Visualization.
The paper also highlights the advantages, techniques of Big Data and illustrates the applications of Augmented Reality in various fields and domains.
The 2D algorithms constructed by previous researchers for data visualization can be reconstructed into a 3D algorithm model which follows the principles of Augmented Reality.

The paper describes the advantages of merging AR and BIG DATA to invent new interesting applications is starting to have a tangible presence.
The main aim is to uncover the problems and ease the issues in visualization of Big Data and at the same time the objective of finding valid solutions for the problems in big data visualization remains.
The sections mentioned below elaborates the present tools, techniques and platforms which cna be used for visualization in big data.
Based on the results, a not so common approach is proposed: the capabilities and methods of virtual and augmented reality could be implemented to achieve visualization of the big data.

The paper also discussed about the applications of AR and big data and fields where it is used. In the later sections, it also discussed about the user interface with presence of trending technologies, such as VR and AR diaplays on the big data visualization.
