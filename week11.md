My reflection for this week is [this paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9373130). 

## Description:

In this paper the authors have explored big data which is being produced by epidemic diseases like covid around the world. They have used the current pandemic data to present a tool for big data visualization and visual analytics of COVID-19 epidemiological data. 

## Previous work: 

Spatial Information:

1. The bubble map or 
2. The choropleth map (Difference in shading)

Issues with bubble map include overlapping bubbles which is addressed by the shading in the choropleth map

Temporal information:

1. Line charts
2. Stacked area charts


## Data Used: 

1. Administrative info 
2. Case details
3. Symptom data
4. Clinical data
5. Exposure data

## Tool features

1. Tool allows to compare 2 different parameters.
2. Multiple parameters can also be used to plot. 
Uniqueness is its ability to suggest the other itemsets. 

## Tool Evaluation

The authors have verified the data being produced by their tool with other existing tools.
