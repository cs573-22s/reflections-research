This paper is an R package describing different visualizations for chromomsal engineering and features of interest. My lab uses this to visualize edited genomes with engineered sequences in a clear way. This package provides a lot more functionality than we use and I was intrested in expanding our usage or build a similar tool for a pipeline we are using.
