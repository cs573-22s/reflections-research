Paper Title: Juvenile Graphical Perception: A Comparison between Children and Adults

This study is interesting because it looks into how graphical information is presented and how it differs when presented to children verus to adults. Data is understood differently between children and adults, and it is important to ensure that we present the data accurately to the target audiences so that the information and message gets across. The results of this study show that children have very similar graphical perception to adults, but they are consistency less accurate at interpreting the visual encoding. Children also interpret a large amount of data that largely effects their education. However, based on this study, it appears that textbook visuals aimed for children are drawn from adult populations rather than children populations. There is very little evidence about children's graphical perceptions. As more research in cognitive development increases, we have found that children and adults have different visual perception and proportional reasoning skills. The purpose of this study was designed to better understand children's graphical perception. The study examines what are the encoding rankings, accuracy when perceiving each encoding type, and patterns of bias in decoding graphical stimuli. The children that were being focused on were the ages of 8-12 because this age group ranges in their cognitive abilities, but they are mature enough to complete their study, they are less likely to make biased errors due to the lack of numerical understandings. The study concludes to inform that childrens ability to understand visualizations is critical to their success in building foundational knowledge and skills. However, it appears that the visualizations made for children rely on graphical perception research conducted for adults. To create better visualizations more suited for children, the study gathered empirical evidence to support design guidelines for children. Children process visualizations in very similar ways to adults but have difficulty making judgements accurately. This study provides work to hopefully prompt visualization researchers to conduct more studies with this important population of visualization users.
