This paper goes into detail about graphical interpretations and using graphs and other visualizations to summarize information. It goes into how there are visualizations being used to highlight relevant data from big data sets. This paper also gives an overview of the various statistical and graphical methods for understanding data extraction, processing, interpretation, summarization and visualization. The authors of this paper mention the goal of having an efficient way to find specific information in big data while also compressing the data into a more digestible form. There are a couple images within the paper displaying that along with the a few inbetween step of what might go into simplifying the output. The various sections of the paper describe the SIV - or the  Summarization, Interpretation and Visualization - approahes for different graphs auch as neural network models. There are also disscussions of the multitude of challenges that accompany interpretation methods, applications, and information sharing. Some of what is focused on is also related to supervised and unsupervised learning and how to graphically represent what it involves. Throughout the paper, there are a 14 different figures that can act as explainations and examples for all of the topics and main points of the paper, while also demonstrating the goals and purpose of the paper. Over all, there are many developing ways of summarizing, interpreting, and visualizing big data and adapting it to different forms of information for different audiences to acquire a clearer understanding of the data being displayed and analyzed.
