## The nature of correlation in scatter plots

In my search through the depths of ideas for scatter plot visualizations, [this](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13423-016-1174-7#:~:text=For%20scatterplots%20with%20gaussian%20distributions,%2C%20however%2C%20remain%20poorly%20understood.) paper seems like a foundation for much of the research into scatter plots. This paper looks at both the discrimination of scatter plots and the magnitude and find that the perception of the r value for discrimination is linear and for magnitude is logarithmic. This is a fundemental law that will influence how experiement relating the perception of scatter plots will be designed and evalutated. Also, the experiemental design and metrics that this paper used (such as JND) will be a good place to start for collecting and evaluating my data should I get to that point. Their results testing different densities and aspect ratios will also help influence design as I now know what factors can or can't influence these perceptions. 

One of these ideas is that the performance is based on the abstract idea of the probability cloud rather than any concrete geometric idea. This means that animations or visualizations that are able to enhance, clarify, and/or compare probability clouds (rather than a concrete geometric idea) would have a greater chance at reienforcing better methods of visual perception in participants. A couple ideas that spring to mind might be a heat map or any way of showing density. Might be an interesting angle to take.
