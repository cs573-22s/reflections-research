Introduction

This paper first caught up my mind because of is graph at the beginning of the paper. The main idea about this paper is synchronous visualization. Because of the Covid-19, working from home being ‘the new normal’. This paper explored potential solutions for collaborating and prototyping remotely from our own homes using the existing tools at our disposal. 
Since different teams have various technical skills, this paper used lots of synchronous remote design tools and methods. 
This paper aimed to preserve the richness of colocated collaboration such as face-to-face physical presence, body gestures, facial expressions, and the making and sharing of physical artifacts. 
While meeting over Zoom, the author sketched on paper and used digital collaboration tools, such as Miro and Google Docs. 
The author articulate their challenges and strategies throughout the process, providing useful insights about synchronous distributed collaboration by using an auto-ethnographic approach.

While descriptions and discussions of visualization design tended to assume co-located design teams, designers clearly need to carry out some work independently and in different locations. 
However, there is important work to be done in considering these contexts for visualization design processes. 
As a step towards developing a better understanding of distributed, synchronous visualization design, this paper provides an experiential understanding and conceptualization of this area.
