In this article with intricate visualizations, the guardian visualized how China's economic slowdown could weigh on the rest of the world. In the year of 2015, up till July, China's customs agency reports that imports from Australia are down by $15bn dollars on the same period last year - a loss which is already equal to 1% of Australia's GDP, and many other countries stand to lose out to similar degrees. China's imports overall are down by 14.6% over 2015. Find out what happens if this decline continues for the rest of the year - or worsens - and how that loss compares to each country's GDP. 

In a different set of visualizations, the effects of a slowdown in China are felt all over the world; China's near neighbor are tied in to its manufacturing processes. Other countries supply it with oil and gas, while some far-away places in Africa and South America provide it with metals and other primary materials. Agricultural produce is important to Brazil and New Zealand. Lastly, several European countries are surprisingly tied in, often for luxury goods. These charts show the projected value of lost exports for 2015 alongside the value of exports for 2014 by major commodities.
