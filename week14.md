Heatmaps can display numerical and spatial data in one chart. This much data is often hard to clearly show, and is missed in common charts such as a scatter plots or tables. 

In big datasets, heatmaps can be easier to interpret patterns and relationships because to shows the frequency of observations in each cell. Heatmaps are really good for correlation data because you can scale the colors [0,1] with a white gradient in between.

This paper provided many examples using various tools to make heatmaps with emphasis on different features. I appreciate that this paper provided code along side images to clearly show what was being discussed.
