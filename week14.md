# Multidimensional data visualization
# Matthew J. Pastizzo, Robert F. Erbacher, and Laurie B. Feldman

## Summary
In this study, the researchers were interested in seeing the impact that multidimensional visualizations had on interpretability. Commonly, most data visualizations are 2D, however some are 3D. In addition, the use of glyphs can increase the dimensionatlity to beyond 8 dimensions. The researchers had participants view data from a psycholinguistic study where other participants were asked to identify if a stimuli was a word or not. The participants evaluating the visualization saw a mixed of 3D scatter or bar plots as well as multidimenionsal glyph charts, such as transparent circles with opaque circles inside.

## Takeaways
Additional dimensionality can make it more difficult to interpret visualizations and in some cases can cause the viewer to make the wrong conclusion. In addition, exploring unstructured data will often lead to erroneous perceptions of the data structure and should be avoided. While this paper is relatively old (published in 2002), it's concepts are still taught in classes today (though perhaps not directly because of this specific paper).
