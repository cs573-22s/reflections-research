This weekâ€™s visualization comes from https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8370203?casa_token=fbvH18X5hZsAAAAA:PK5ZD9rs-K8TlVJwE6-1YdZfM4IV0tqCt1i3a3urbOVooXuGm3v4wD_Fya6NwW_TWIHv1bWPCw. It studies the use of visualizations in elementary schools. The authors share their reflections on visualization literacy, which is the ability to interpret visualizations, and how it can be better used at an elementary education level with younger students. These researchers studied how visualizations are introduced to students at an early age and how well they can decipher and interpret them.

For the experiment, the researchers collected and analyzed pedagogical artifacts to get a better understanding of what visualizations were taught at elementary schools. They also talked with teachers to understand how they went about teaching their students. They also created a tablet-based technology probe that was used to teach pictographs and bar charts, which was sent out to two classrooms to measure how students learned about these graphs and how to understand them. 

These researchers learned that visualizations are heavily used in elementary classrooms to teach new concepts and convey information, but this was still only a small part of what students were learning. They also found that teachers believe visualizations to be relatively intuitive, and that other parts of the curriculum are harder for students to understand, yet they also believed that students were not prepared to fully understand the visualizations given to them. Most students learned how to read visualizations, but not how to critically think about them. Overall, technology does help teach students how to think critically, and allows them to process information in ways that they otherwise would not be able to.
