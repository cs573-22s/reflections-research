VINE: An Open Source Interactive Data Visualization Tool for Neuroevolution

Currently, deep neuro-evolutionary algorithms such as evolution strategies (ES) and genetic algorithms (GA) have the capability to train deep neural networks. But these algorithms so complicated such that it is harder for researchers hard to understand and analyze the underlying process of neuro-evolution in such high dimensions. 
To help with this problem, a bucnh of researchers have created a interactive data visualization tool called VINE(VIsual Inspector for Neuro Evolution) aimed at helping researchers and end users better understand this family of algorithms
They've applied the VINE to the famous Mujoco Humanoid Locomotion which is solved by both ES and GA. The ES popularized algorithm in which the neural networks called pseudo offsprings are optimized against an objective over generations and the parameters for these indvidual offsprings are perturbed from the parent neural network. In the humanoid locomotion ecah movement is controlled by the psudo offspring and has a fitness score based on how well it walks. Considering the previous score the ES then aggregates parameters for next pseudo offsprings fitness scores and the cycle repeats
Several visualization are also present to explore the overall trend of the pseudo-offsprings in quantitative and spatial distribution, parents, and, top performers. Clicking on any plot will also reveal the behavioral information and fitness scoress of pseudo offsprings and parents across generations.
