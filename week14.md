Week 14 Reflection - Quality Metrics in High-Dimensional Data Visualization: An Overview and Systematization
--

Extraction information from high dimensionality data is always a hard task to deal with. There are already existing quality metrics used to automate the increasing search within large spaces of alternative visualizations. For instance, people are looking at alternative projections or ordering. These would allow users to concentrate on the most promising visualizations suggested by the quality metrics. There is a set of factors set for discriminating the quality metrics, visualization techniques, and the process itself. The process is described through a reworked version of the well-known information visualization pipeline. The paper demonstrates the usefulness of the model by applying it to several existing approaches that use quality metrics, and the paper provides reflections on implications of our model for future research.

In the paper they have explained a systematic analysis of quality metrics as a way to suppport the exploration of high-dimensional datasets. With existing paper explaining the systematic approaches that explore configurations automatically found by the algorithm, this paper provides a solution to resolve ordering problem with high-dimensionality data.
