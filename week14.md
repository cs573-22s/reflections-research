Paper Title: Student Residential Distance Calculation using Haversine Formulation and Visualization through GoogleMap for Admission Analysis

This article uses data mining to extract the increase in marketing of a respective educational organization. It observes students from different localities to join a perspective college, where the distance from the address of student residence to destination is analyzed. Distance is being calculated using the Haversines formula and the clustering algorithm to cluster the locations and get more accurate results. Then, they utilize data visualization by pictorial representations that help the organization to concentrate on more specific areas to improve the advertisement to help improve the admission rate. This paper focuses on the location and distance analysis. The proposed system is to focus on the circle distance  or orthodromic distance which is defined by the shortest distance between two points by using the coordinates on the surface of the earth. This paper creates visualizations about how different states differ from how the distance between student's beginning location and their destination differ. By utilizing these visualizations, the study is looking to improve admissions rates for the following year, by improving the marketing of the school in the surrounding areas. This will create more awareness of the school, improving the popularity of the institution, hotels, wholesale industry, etc. This flow of marketing can be presented in a flow chart which is another type of data visualization. While the marketing of the organization will assist the awareness of the school's presence, due to the distance based analysis, the data will not be able to provide accurate results, but instead provide the results in terms of frequency. It will be able to provide a numerical formula to calculate the exact orthodromic distance between the two locations for each student. Clustering similar locations together will make it easier to concentrate more on that particular area allowing researchers to concentrate on more specific neighborhoods.
