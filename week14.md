# Evidnece on the Role of Mental Translation

[This](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.125.5463&rep=rep1&type=pdf) paper talks about the role of mental translation in pattern matching and the effects of spatial separation. While not directly related to data vis, this paper is quite useful because it gives foundation to the ideas of graph comparison that I'm researching in my final project. Some of the big points they found was tha orientation and rotation of the patterns that people were comparing did not have too much of an effect on the results. This means that any sort of feedback that rotates the patterns may not be effective because it would be reienforcing something that does not really effect performance. They also found that when the patterns were futher apart, participants were more likely to judge them as different. This is helpful because it helps us realize that there is a difference that should be considered when deciding the distance between the two patterns. It also gives merit to the idea of mental translation as increased distances might be more difficult to translate, thus not giving participants a chance to do it as quickly. Overall this paper helps give a foundation to how people percieve comparisons like this.
