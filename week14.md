["Rethinking Map Legends with Visualization"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5613425)

Another paper by Jason Dykes and Jo Wood focused specifically on map legends.
In this slightly older look at map legends, Dykes and Wood discuss their process and findings
in experimenting with several different ways to display necessary information on maps. 
Legends are needed to help the viewer understand what they're looking at, and they should
ideally, be seen first before the user has to try and decipher the map and its symbols.
The most convenient legend might be just no legend at all if all the symbols were self-explanatory,
so how might you be able to take that notion concerning designing your legend? The first
interesting approach I took note of while reading this paper was the map as a legend approach. 
Where, by overlaying the legend on specific examples of each symbol and washing out the actual map,
you can show the viewer the legend before they proceed to the real map without needing to take up 
space with a real legend. The other examples of legends included ones where Dykes and Wood had
incorporated other data visualization techniques into the legend itself. By incorporating bar charts
or a treemap into the legend you can show other useful data or specify the legend to only include
objects or items that are currently on the screen or that hold importance to the viewer. For example,
by splitting up the total land on a map into a treemap you can make the breakdown more specific or 
less specific depending on the information shown on the map and in the legend. Including breakdowns
like matrix views into the legends can also compress their size and provide a more concise explanation.
Overall, the ideas for legends presented in this paper were pretty solid and I think they will continue
to serve as inspiration for future designers.
