This paper's main topic is multimodal interaction and the new benefits and challenegs it brings. This paper is a collection abstracts from a worksop reguarding this topic. The multimodal interactions are gaining attention in that they are a new option reguarding versatility in the hardware displays used for visualization. It is also for the use of large scale interaction designs like VR and large display types instead of the usual interactions. Other simpler displays have interactions through single inputs such as mouse, button, pen, etc. Many of the abstracts mention integrating multimodal interactions for the combination of different platforms. Others are about the interaction between different sensory inputs and the display mode. Having such a variety of papers discusing different points of interaction and the range of input types is a testament to the complexity of the multimodal visulaization possibilities. Also, becasue of this, there is alot of room for imporvemnt and for the expanding types of input. There are also some papers reguarding the user interest and interface interaction tracking with the display instead of just multi-display and method interaction.
