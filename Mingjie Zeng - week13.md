This week's paper is Animated Exploration of Graphs with Radial Layout: http://zesty.ca/pubs/infovis-2001-submit.pdf

In this paper, the authors describe a new animation technique for supporting interactive exploration of a graph, building on the wellknown radial tree layout method and they apply this
technique to visualizations of social networks and of the Gnutella file-sharing network.

I found this paper interesting because our project has something about the network graphs and we found that the network structure is important and somehow complecated. And also, visualizing a network structure need the data to be well structured. So given the data, generating the network visualization is a challenging task.
In this paper, the authors consider visualizations in which the view of the graph is determined by the selection of a single node as the center of interest, or focus. The main contribution of this work is a new technique for animating the transitions from one view to the next, in a smooth, appealing manner that minimizes confusion.
And here is the visualization of the Gnutella network:

And here is an good point that this method can change the focused node with smooth animation, both keep the original orientation of the edges between the nodes and the ordering of the nodes' neighbors.

The new method for animating the transitions from one view to the next in an appealing manner that minimizes confusion is well performed and useful.
