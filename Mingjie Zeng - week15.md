The title of this week's paper is Data Changes Everything: Challenges and Opportunities in Data Visualization Design Handoff: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8816695

There are gaps between data characterization tools, visualization design tools, and development platforms which will pose challenges for designer-developer teams working to create new data visualizations. It requires collaboration between people with different visualization-related
skills. The authors report observations and reflections from five large multidisciplinary visualization design
projects and highlight six data-specific visualization challenges for design specification and handoff. These challenges include adapting
to changing data, anticipating edge cases in data, understanding technical challenges, articulating data-dependent interactions,
communicating data mappings, and preserving the integrity of data mappings across iterations. And based on these observations, the authors give some advice on future tools for prototyping, testing, and communicating data-driven designs, which may make visualization design easier to be successful.

There are five visualization design and development projects in which the authors observed:

For every project that picked up, there should be a variety of design-related roles to complete the progress of design. And the authors documented the full design and discussion process, judging and analyzing the difficulties in the process through various aspects of reflection. 

We all know that there would be many challenges when it comes to design and publish a new visualization, I think the methods that the authors used to record these challenges in this paper are actrually we can learn from. To make progress, we need to know where the limitations are. 
It is not only necessary to do so in the process of research and development of visualization, but also in the path of research and development in all fields, this method of determining the direction of development through experimentation and analysis is worth learning.
