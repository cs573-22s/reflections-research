This paper is a discussion on the purposes of focusing and linking for graphical data analysis. These are important aspects to consider when dealing with high dimentional data or anything to do with visualizations using interactions or motion. This paper goes through different types of data visualizations including scatter plots, time series, image data. This information could be applied to many types of information feilds. The paper discusses linking as a way to minimize the visual overload while maintaining the information output. There is discussion of the advangatge of having multiple views linked to the same data instead of having too much information included in one view. But, when using multiple views, the focus should be on how they fit together to convey the appropriate data or information. Also through linking various images or points, it can allow for interactive 3 dimentional images that can be rotated or moved by the user. Though with the added benefit of being able to break down the views and bring focus to specific aspects, there is also the risk of not addressing all of the crucial aspects. Theis would lead to a portion of the informatio ot be excluded and bring confusion to the viewer. Therefroe a cohesive layout of the multiple views or the various viewing types should be clear and well plannned in order to have the desired messgae or effect.
