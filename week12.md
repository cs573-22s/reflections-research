This weekâ€™s reflection paper is based on the following article: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5613429?casa_token=D9AqvS6Y8WcAAAAA:Mmn52wmNYEV327ABei-qXCidPn-sDxzhThBXdoBIJjcpgR_tElerOQGsIY7H8XRY4oahCC2Hsg. This paper goes into how to effectively display multiple timelines. Line graphs have been around since 1786 when they were invented by William Playfair. This paper is about the study of a lack of knowledge of graphical perception for multiple time series by using different line graph techniques. The researchers used lab experiments to study these. Their evaluation criteria included space management, space per series, identity, baseline, and visual clutter. They then used those to evaluate simple line graphs, small multiples, stacked graphs, horizon graphs, and braided graphs. They studied user performance different line graph visualizations across different time series. 

The results of the paper show that creating separate charts for each time series is more efficient for comparisons across series with a large visual span. Standard line graphs, which are a shared-space technique, are usually more efficient for comparisons over smaller visual spans where clutter and confusion can be avoided. The results also included that the visualization type is not significant for correctness, so participants were careful no matter the type of graph.
