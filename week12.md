For this weeks research reflection I decided to look at big data ans what are some of the cahllenges and methods for vizualicing it. In the paper the author argue that visualizing data allows us to better understand trends in the data we are observing. One key point oberved in this study was that observing big data compared to using raw numbers improved decision making by 77%. 
Among the challenged of big data visualizations they found:
1. semi/non formated data
2. Setting the dimensions of the data: when done wrong, patterns can be lost or missed
3. Sacalability is usually an issue

Some of the suggested tools that they found helpful when visualizing big data were:
* Tableu
* Power BI
* Plotly
* Gephi
* Excel
