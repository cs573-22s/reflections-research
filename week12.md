Paper Title: Data visualization: an exploratory study into the software tools used
Abstract by businesses

This article is examining how data visualizations are used in business, and the different types of tools that used to create these visualizations. The software being tested included Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Power BI, Tableau, and IBM Watson Analytics. They looked into a real life situation about a dataset of bike supple chain stores. The dataset explored bike sales by different territories of the US, Canada, Germany, UK, and France and a dataset about US territories. Each software program was tested for its usability for creating necessary data visualizations and comparing the skill level of business students. While all of the software programs were able to be create the necessary visualizations and information, some software was proven to be easier than others. They found that each software system had their own benefits, with some being easier to create graphs while others had easier ways to edit the visualizations and more flexability. The paper concludes that it would be better preparation for business students to be prepared with knowledge of how to use data visualization software, as the popularity and usage of it in business grows more and more important every day.
