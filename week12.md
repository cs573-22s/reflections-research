Paper: GraphOmics: an interactive platform to explore and integrate multi-omics data

This paper provides a tool for multi-omics data exploration. It gives researchers the ability to conduct complex bioinformatic analysis in a web-browser. This is a very cool tool with good final visualizations that are often only available through coding that is now being accessbile for any researcher with internet access.

However, it does not provide as much customization as I would like, but it is still a very nice tool that can be helpful for a lot of applications.
