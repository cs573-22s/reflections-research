In her paper "Principles of High-Dimensional Data Visualization in Astronomy", Alyssa Goodman makes the case for the use of interactive exploratory data visualization simultaneously with statistical analysis in order to analayze high-demensional data sets. Goodman identifies the usefulness of "linked view" systems where a researcher causes live updates in different views of a dataset by manipulating one of the views, observing that this method is under-utilized in astronomy and astrophysics research, especially with how visual these fields historically are. Goodman also recognizes that analysis techniques should take advantage of humans' natural affinity for pattern recognition by combining our visualization capabilities with statistical principles. In this paper, various high-dimensional visualization and manipulation tools and software from outside the field of astronomy are identified and reviewed in order to characterize how similar methods could be developed in astronomy research. 

I found this paper to be very interesting. Goodman outlines the usefulness of "modular open-source high-dimensional linked-view data visualization environments" in a way that can be generalized beyond her field of astronomy. I agree that these sort of visualization environments are extremely useful. Previously, I've thought that using visualizations for data analysis seemed like it could lead to subjective conclusions, but I see from her paper that visualizations used in concert with statistical analysis in order to take advantage of human pattern recognition is an excellent technique that could revolutionize certain scientific fields. One such tool that I've used is UCSF Chimera, which allows the user to visualize and analyse molecular structures and related data.
