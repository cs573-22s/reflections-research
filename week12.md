# Effectiveness of Animation in Trend Visualization

Pretaining to the area of my project in animation, [this](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4658146) paper describes the limitations of animation in visualizing trends. It also suggests some alternitives to animation in the form of overlaying the time series data shown, or using small multiple. They point out much of the research that has been done into animations and the issues with animation in use for trends. However, much of the sources they refer to do concede that animation for transitions is probably much more effective than animation for trends (yay me). In the experiment, they showed participants either an animation, trace visualization, or small multiple of the same data sets and evaluated their retention and understanding of the information by asking a series of questions about the data. They found that the animations preformed worse than they traces and the small multiples overall. However, when the participants were asked to rate which ones they enjoyed the most, animation was rated the highest for enjoyability. This poses an interesting question: if the participants (or any other people) were randomly looked at graphs or data online, would they pay attention more to an animation? Would they deem a small multiple or a traces vis too complicated to parse and move on? The users in the study were trained before on how to view and understand each vis with a tutorial task. While this does control the experiment better, it also ignores that animation is much more intuitive to our mind and generally understood by everyone. Motion perception is programmed into our brains, while small multiples may not be (though i can see someone arguing that it might). Regardless, I think this study does a good job of describing the limitations of animation as a robust tool for presenting data, but I think there are still opportunities for animation to improve upon small multiples and traces in the areas of accesibility, aestetic, and attention from the user.
