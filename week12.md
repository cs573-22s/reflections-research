# Week 12

My reflection for this week:

## [DebateVis: Visualizing Political Debates for Non-Expert Users](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9331282)

DebateVis link: https://web.northeastern.edu/debatevis/

Political debates are important for people to understand the perspective of the candidates. However, not all people have time to look into the debates. Even if they do, they not all information in the debate can be consumed by all the people. So, this paper introduces a tool called DebateVis to help non-expert users understand and analyze debates.

While the data visualiation is pretty straight forward, I like how the paper follows the Munzner's data and tasks abstraction process. The authors follows three iterative design process to get to the final design. In the first phase, they had informal interviews with faculty in political science and journalism at Northeastern University to get the first set of goals. 

Second phase involved development of a visualization and usability testing with 5 students. From the testing, they get feedback to add new a new goal and its related task. 

On the third phase, they again test the system with non expert users. They find that chord diagram is difficult for users to understand. Which they replaced with network diagram.

So, basically, to get to a final design, I like how the authors rigourously refined the goals and tasks, to ensure that the any debates can be easily analyzed by non-expert users.
