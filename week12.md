Data-driven intelligent transportation systems utilize
data resources generated within intelligent systems to improve the
performance of transportation systems and provide convenient
and reliable services. Traffic data refer to datasets generated and
collected on moving vehicles and objects. Data visualization is
an efficient means to represent distributions and structures of
datasets and reveal hidden patterns in the data. This paper introduces the basic concept and pipeline of traffic data visualization,
provides an overview of related data processing techniques, and
summarizes existing methods for depicting the temporal, spatial,
numerical, and categorical properties of traffic data.

Large data brings numerous opportunities and challenges
to the field of traffic data analysis. Traffic data visualization

performs a key function in addressing the problems arising from
large-scale, multi-modal, and unstructured data. This paper
provides an overview of relevant visualization techniques and
visual analysis systems in the context of traffic analysis, and
presents the common data flow in traffic data visualization.
According to the characteristics of traffic data, visualization
techniques for traffic analysis are presented in four aspects:
temporal, spatial, spatio-temporal, and multi-variable. Existing
traffic visualization applications and visual analytics systems
are presented based on the analysis tasks.
Performing analysis tasks in real-time is difficult when the
data size if large. Few works supporting visual analysis of big
traffic data are available. Ferreira et al. [14] presented a system
that supports visual exploration of huge spatio-temporal data.
However, developments do not stop in the design of such a
system. Thus, the analysis in situation-aware and immersive
environments are promising directions.
Visual analytics provides a comprehensible way to analyze
data and consequently significantly improves the efficiency
and accuracy of the analysis. In the context of ITS, visual
analytics can accomplish various tasks, such as route planning,
traffic jam detection, accident monitoring and flow patterns
recognition. However, most existing traffic visualization and
visual analytics systems employ offline data. Designing and
implementing systems using on-line and streaming data may
be a potential research direction.
Benefiting from the development and popularization of sensor technology, data sources related to traffic data are currently
growing in number. For instance, video surveillance [24] has
been combined with road incident data for better monitoring.

We believe that visual analysis of heterogeneous data from
different sources (e.g., social media) will be the next research
topic on data-driven ITS.
Another interesting direction is the visualization and visual
analytics of social transportation, with an aim of collecting,
analyzing, and utilizing data from cyber, physical, and social
spaces for ITS
