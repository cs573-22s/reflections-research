This week I found a very interesting research paper, it's about a team of researchers designs and implements the information visualization system of ATM alarm data.

Bank ATM machines are used to install monitoring equipment. When an ATM machine fails or other issues occur, the monitoring device can transmit an alert message and provide significant volumes of relevant data for analysis, which includes the alarm message. The alarm data generated by the ATM machine is saved in SQL Server databases and on the local disk array. However, the vast majority of the alert data are false alarms, with just a tiny percentage being real.

As a result, this study focuses on two issues. For starters, data visualization may aid company managers construct company strategy by making complexity alarm data more comprehensive. Second, data visualization can help to understand the link between the network, the equipment, the issue, the alert, and the cause. By minimizing false alarms, data visualization helps remind users of the genuine alert, minimize false alarm rates, and enhance operational service levels.
