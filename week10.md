Paper Title: Why Shouldn’t All Charts Be Scatter Plots?

This paper is discusssing the importance of creating visuals that are easily readable for people to understand and why certain data is best presented through visualizations like scatter plots. However, it also explains that certain data can be better represented in other methods. This paper states that quantitative data should always be plotted on a dot plot or scatter plot. This can be done by breaking up data based on various attributes or multiples. This would employ linking certain plots when there is too many datapoints for one view. This paper discusses the three classes of insufficiencies. The first premise is the accuracy in the extraction of data values is a sufficient measure of perceptual precision. The second premise is that perceptual precision is a sufficient measure of a chart’s utility in communicating data. The third premise is that utility in communicating data is sufficient to understand the larger purpose and power of visualizations. The paper concludes by explaining how there are several textbook explainations that explain the visual effiecency of certain graphs, yet they do not capture the important components about how people interpret, analyze and conceptualize visualizations. By doing this, we are in danger of only using certain visualizations that are not as effective for portraying information, and therefore doing a diservice to the data all together.
