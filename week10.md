# Memorability of visual features in network diagram


This paper investigates whether visual features like symmetry, alignment, collinearity, axis alignment and orthogonality affect our ability to recall network diagrams.

## Experiment

For each of the 6 visual features, with additional alternative topology for 4 visual features and one without any feature, 4 graphs structures were created. Each of the 4 graph sizes vary in complexity by number of nodes and edges. So, there was a total of 44 experimental drawings. 
Each of these drawings were presented to the participants for 3 seconds. After showing each drawing, participants were asked to draw the same diagram. 

For the pilot study, node link diagrams were tested with 7 to 9 nodes and 9 to 11 edges. Participants were given a total of 25 seconds. However, they found that it was difficult for participants to recall the drawings. So, the main experiment was carried out with 3s and ~5 nodes.


## Result and Analysis

Two analysis were conducted for the experiment. The first analysis was done to see if visual cues helped participants to recall the layout of nodes and edges and also their mapping. The second analysis was done to check if visual features were preserved.

The analysis supported the hypothesis that the presence of visual features aid accurate recall of a network diagram. It was found that symmetry  performed significantly better. Similarly, second analysis supported the hypothesis that visual features would be recalled with orthogonality, collinearity and symmetry having higher chances of being preserved. However, there is no support for preservation of node-allighment or parallel edges.
