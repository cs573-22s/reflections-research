For this weeks reflection I will talk about this academic paper:

"Data Changes Everything: Challenges and Opportunities in Data Visualization Design Handoff" https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8816695

This paper starts of by showing that there can be a gap between developers and designers when creating a vizulizations. And this gap can be caused by differnt factors including the data and tools used when working together. They look at the problem and draw information from 5 differnt project working on differnt data visulizations, and evaluate what the challenges are across these projects.

they then go into details about the process of creating a large data visualization, Starting of by having a group of people that share a set of skills and together, and as the project moves on it becomes more segmented. This process is comparable to the sofware development process inlvolving design and developlent pahses with multple iterations.

They are able to identify 6 challenges that they faced when working on the 5 projects mentioned above:

Adapting to data changes: This can affect the selection of graphics since they are data dependantl.
Anticipating edge cases: Edge cases can cause the mapping of the data to break.
Understanding technical constraints: This leads to uncertinty on the feasinility of the design.
Articulating Data-Dependent Interactions: This adds a level of complexity and dimesions to the data.
Communicating data mappings
Preserving Data Mapping Integrity across iterations
When working on complex projects data related problems can ocurre at all levels of the design process. And recomend the creation of mor powerfull tools that could be helpful during the developent process.
