## Reflection

The paper I am reviewing this week is "Making Data Tangible: A Cross-disciplinary Design Space for Data Physicalization" by S. Sandra Bae, Clement Zheng and more. The reason I am reviewing this paper is because of my general interest in the topic of data physicalization and other forms of unique data visualization beyond paper. While this paper did not create or test any data physicalizations itself it reviewed and "Coded" popular papers in the field. This coding process aimed to categorize each of the physicalizations by context, structure and interactions. Personally the two fields I am most interested in are context and interactions to see if utilizing the two in specific ways can help data visualizations more effectivly effect its audience. We see that data physicalizations created for a specific audience may have more influence in them, but most of the works were created for a general audience. Another finding was the material choices were often dependent on the type of data as some materials could speak more while other projects were more focused on shape/ interactability than material. Lastly sensorary interactions were the most significant in affecting the users understanability of the data. Overall maybe a little disapointed in paper as it was not very conclusive in many cases, but still find the field rather interesting.
