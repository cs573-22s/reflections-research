For our final project, and my research project, I am interested in creating an interactive network viasualization. Specifically, I would like to create some sort of visualization for WGCNA analysis. I am still trying to figure out what that will look like so I started researching network visualizations and found this network visualization review paper that expalins what considerations and applications are useful when creating and analyzing a network visualization. 

Table 2 provided a very useful comparison of existing network visualization tools and what exactly they did in clear and concise manner. The way that they used smaller visualizations above Table 2 to describe the columns in Table 2 were very helpful in explaining the difference between tasks.
