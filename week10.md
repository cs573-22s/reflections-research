# Seeing is believing: The effect of brain images on judgements of scientific reasoning
# David McCabe and Alan Castel

## Summary
In this paper, researchers were interested in understanding how much participants _trust_ the results of a study based on the type of visualization used. They chose the neuroscience domain because of the perceived conception that brain images have a persuasive influence on public perception of research. They did two separate experiments, one comparing conclusions drawn from brain images and bar graphs and the other compared conclusions draw from brain images and a topographical map of brain activation. Each experiment used a control with no image. For each experiment, they provided the participants with three short articles that made claims that were not necessitated by the data, such as watching TV is related to math ability because they both cause activation in the temporal lobe. Of the three articles, one included the brain image, one included no image and explained the data in text, and one included the testing variable (either a bar chart or topographical mapping of activation). Afterwards, participants were asked a series of questions about the article, such as if it was well written, if the title described the results, and if the scientific reasoning made sense. Their results showed that people trusted and thought more positively of articles that used a brain image in comparison to other types of visualizations.

## Take away
The take away from this can be viewed from two perspectives, that of a researcher and that of a reviewer. As a researcher who is aiming to present their data in a paper with visualizations, brain images are the most persuasive way to make an argument. However, this may limit the amount of critique and discussion caused by the results of the research and possibly lead to incorrect conclusions or assumptions, particular with readers who are not familiar with the domain. As a paper reader or reviewer, it may be beneficial to know that brain images may positively bias their perception towards agreeing with the results. Reviewers could use this information to be more critical or attentive when reading about data that is represented by brain images as compared to bar charts or topographical mappings.
