This is a recent paper that talks about the start of the spread of Covid-19 in China. As the paper goes through the 5 stages of the pandemic (initial stage, diffusion stage, control stage, closing stage, and prevention of overseas import), there are map visualizations depicting the analysis of number of cases nationwide. Along with the maps, it has time series graphs that show the change in case types including cumulative confirmed, cured, suspected, serious, existing confirmed, and cumulative death cases. Along with the nationwide cases, more specifically, each province is colored on a gradient that is based on the number of cases within that area. This method of visualization is an excelent way to easily and clearly display how and to what degree the virus has spread during each stage. It is also an effective aid in understanding the evolution of the spread of the virus though each stage. Some of what the government takes into account when making the policies and actions in reguards to preventing the spread and increase in case number could be explained though this paper and the mapping of the pandemic. Because a map image of a data set of this type is easier to process than something like a data table, it would be better recieved for those who might not be able to fully process what the data means if it were just numerical values. This type of visualization could be used for any country or virus tracking that might need to be done. After more data is collected fro other coutries, this information could be analyzed in order to create a more detailed and effective plan for dealing with future potential disease or virus outbreaks.
