This chapter elaborates on the definition of data visualization, highlights its historical development, and offers examples of how data visualization has been used in evaluations to help aid understanding, collect data and information, conduct analysis, and communicate to a variety of stakeholders. This chapter also outlines future trends in data visualization and their potential influence on evaluation practice. The chapter concludes with some of the main limitations and cautions that are associated with data visualization. © Wiley Periodicals, Inc., and the American Evaluation Association.One of the main challenges in writing a chapter on visualization and evaluation is that data visualization is very broad in scope and can encompass anything from qualitatively based phrase nets, such as in Figure 1.1, to quantitatively derived charts, such as in Figure 1.2. There are also various visualizations that fall within this spectrum, some pushing 71NEW DIRECTIONSFOR EVALUATION, no. 139, Fall 2013    © Wiley Periodicals, Inc., and the American Evaluation Association.

Our intention in the issue is to introduce the evaluation community to visu-alization developments that have the potential to change or improve how we evaluate. But, as with any new idea or approach, we are likely to encounter 15,826100193.74Fig.3DID AVAS CAUSETHE U.S. HOUSING BUBBLE?281 Avas19912009Housingprice indexBabiesnamed “Ava” Figure 1.16.

This pro-cess of learning, struggle, and development has been described in the tech-nology arena as the Hype Cycle (Fenn & Time, 2008; Figure 1.17). The five-phase Hype Cycle begins with the technological trigger, when the new idea or concept is introduced. This is followed by mass excitement and over-estimation of its relevance and benefit—the peak of inflated expectations. Next, as we begin to recognize the limitations associated with the technology, we enter the trough of disillusionment, followed by a slow but steady progres-sion to understanding its actual potential as we climb the slope of enlighten-ment. Finally we reach the plateau of productivity, characterized by acceptance and wide adoption of the technology by the communities it serves.We anticipate that some of the ideas and concepts introduced in this chapter and issue will follow the Hype Cycle trajectory, beginning with increased expectations as the tools and approaches are implemented across various evaluation projects and with multiple evaluation stakeholders that may or may not be well suited. As time progresses, the limitations and drawbacks  of  different  visualizations  will  become  more  apparent  and heightened expectations will become more tempered. Ultimately we believe that our community will progress along the slope of enlightenment and move toward the plateau of productivity. During these last two stages, the appropriate use of visualizations in evaluation will become more evi-dent, many of the limitations will be acknowledged, and some may even be solved.

Regardless of the rise or fall of specific visualization platforms and strate-gies, we believe that data visualization is here to stay. It will continue to evolve and will increasingly play a critical role in the evaluation process.
