# Correlation judgement

[This paper](https://visualthinking.psych.northwestern.edu/publications/YangCorrelation2018.pdf) compares the effectiveness of different techniques to compare corralations. Much of the math goes way over my head, but I did find the table of ideas very interesting and the idea of visual features very helpful. More specifically, the idea that visual features that highly correlate with a participants judgement are what the participant uses to make judgements is an interesting topic. If a participant mentally draws an eclipse and moves the two charts on top of each other, how does one make that mental rotation easier? Should we find the highest overall performing feature and train participants to use that? These are some interesting questions that I hope to explore with my final project. One thing that could be important is animating these to add another way of trying to match up with how people visualize. 

While I may need more time/years of my life to understand the math, I do really like this idea of trying to replicate what a person may be doing in their own head. Though that may not be the entire point of the paper it is interesting enough to warrent some exploration. Thoughts that pop into my head are a mix and match interface where a user can create some feedback that they like the most. For example, someone may resonate with an animation that draws and ellipse and moves the charts together while another may prefer just having a line of best fit. An interesting area of research to say the least.
