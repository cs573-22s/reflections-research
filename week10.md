The paper "What Makes a Visualization Memorable?" by Borkin et al. aims to identify which kinds of visualizations are the most memorable and the most forgettable. They observe that understanding and memorability are connected; therefore, it's important to study what makes visualizations memorable in order to learn how to make them effective. They also identify that there is a divide in the visualization community concerning the usefulness of "excessive chart annotation and decoration". In order to answer questions about what makes visualizations effective, engaging, and memorable, Borkin et al. ran a study using over 2000 single-panel visualizations labelled with attributes like visual density, color, and type. Memorability scores for the visualizations were calculated based on how often participants could idenitify that a visualization was one that they had seen earlier in the sequence. 

Borkin et al. found that visualizations containing pictograms of human recognizable objects such as cartoons or photos on average had a higher memorability score than those without. They also found that visualizations with 7 or more colors, high visual density, and low data-to-ink ratios had higher memorability. Diagrams were also more memorable that points, bars, lines, and tables, and infographics were the most memorable category of visualization source. Overall, I think these findings are useful for my final project, as they made me consider more closely what visualizations I may want to use and what attributes they should have.
