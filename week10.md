# Week 7:

My reflection for this week is [this paper](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Benjamin-Bach/publication/331357753_Comparing_Effectiveness_and_Engagement_of_Data_Comics_and_Infographics/links/5cb859aaa6fdcc1d499cc3b1/Comparing-Effectiveness-and-Engagement-of-Data-Comics-and-Infographics.pdf). 

## Description:

This paper explores the effectiveness of infographics and data comics in terms of their effecitveness for data-driven story telling. The authors have conducted experiments to explore this area. 

## Description of experiments: 

1. The authors have created 3 different stories for lab studies. They have chosen stories which are comfortably presented on A3 paper and also stories which require little prior knowledge. 
2. The three stories are on Energy, Alliacnes and Economics. The authors have tried to keep the level of complexity of all stories as same. All fpnts were made same as well.

## Hypotheses

1. The understanding order should be Comic > Infographic > Illustrated text. (Making a visual and verbal connection improves understanding)
2. The engagement order should be Comic, Infographic > Illustrated text. (More fun to read)
3. The memorability order should be Comic > others. (More organized)

## Data Collection 

1. Error rate
2. Story Recalls
3. Subjective scores
4. Qualitative feedback
5. Reading paths

## Results 
1. Results were consistent with the hypothesis in the understanding and engagement. Not enough evidence was there to prove memorability. 
2. Since this was a lab study, questions still remained of how comics compare in more valid settings. 
3. In the wild study was also conducted.

## Findings
1. Data Comics improve engagement and understanding.
2. Large text-picture distance impairs understanding.
3. Infographics foster exploration

## Limitations
1. Type of stories.
2. Design choices.
3. Audience. 
4. Story formats.
