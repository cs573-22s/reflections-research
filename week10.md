Introduction
---
This paper discusses two basic principles for interactive visualization of high dimensional data: focusing and linking. 
The paper and the accompanying video give examples of how graphical data analysis methods based on foucusing and linking are used in applications including linguistics, geographic informetion systems, time series analysis, and the analysis of multi-channel images arising in radiology and remote sensing.

Focusing and linking are principles that offer a solution to the problem of visual overload. 
Instead of maximizing the informetion in a single view, it is better to provide tools for quickly generating multiple views, each focussed on a different aspect of the data.
Multiple views, however, should not be regarded partial information contained in individual views into a coherent image of the data as a whole.
