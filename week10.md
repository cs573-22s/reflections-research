["Why Shouldnâ€™t All Charts Be Scatter Plots? Beyond Precision-Driven Visualizations"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.11310.pdf)

This paper stood out to me because of a passing thought I had while completing A3 and learning about Cleveland & McGill,
since this bar graph scores the best, why isn't it always used for data visualizations? This paper poses essentially
the same question, but with another equally perceivable graph, the scatter plot. The argument is immediately 
disproven with the first posed question as they show a very famous visualization by Charles Minard and how its information
would be displayed on a set of scatter plots. While they point out that the scatterplots do inform the reader more
accurately about the specific number of survivors and their position, that level of detail isn't what's truly important
to this visualization. The paper goes on to talk about later how the general trend of information oftentimes is 
easier to understand and what the viewer is looking for, that combined with the ability for the original visualization
to be viewed on a map only adds to its ability to portray information. So obviously, the scatter plot isn't the best
choice for every situation, but it might still be the clear majority when numerical values matter. The paper mostly
then talks about how there are a very large number of possible tasks in which comparisons might be made, and in listing
around 15 broader areas the authors highlight how certain graphs complement certain tasks. The paper presents one such
display as six different graphs showing the same information. Not only do different graphs tend to hint at different types
of comparisons, which the authors talk about later like continuous trend comparisons versus individual comparisons
between two values, but the different graphs also show information better in specific ways. 
The authors also note that even the heat map can convey some specific trends easier than any of
the other graphs can. All in all, this paper solves a rather silly question fairly quickly, but its analysis of 
why and how we might want to perceive information is worthwhile, especially after learning about Cleveland & McGill.
