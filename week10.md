This week’s reflection is on the following paper: https://www-tandfonline-com.ezpv7-web-p-u01.wpi.edu/doi/full/10.1080/15309576.2019.1592763. This paper describes how data visualization should be used to promote performance information in order to make better use out of it. It can be very difficult to effectively analyze and display large quantities of data, even if it can be incredibly useful. This specific paper focuses on information that public health managers use to help with decision-making and how studying that can help with promoting other public organizations to integrate performance-reporting frameworks into their decision-making processes. The article also points out that the use of data, rather than just the adoption has been the challenging part for organizations.  

The paper provides examples of different tables and figures to help support their argument. The results of the experiment show that graphically displayed information is much more likely to be used, rather than numerical information. This demonstrates that information is easier to digest when displayed in a visual manner rather than a numerical one. This research helps show that other organizations should also put in work to make the switch to more of a visual display. The definition of how they “use” it can be different for each organization, as the article points out that the decision-making process is different as well.
